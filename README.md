# captain-contraption

A set of useful tools for managing a Linux system. 

# Overview

I could have named this project _admin-tools_, but that would have been too boring. Fortunately, an online thesaurus 
helped me derive a better name. Of all the possible synonyms for _admin_ and _tools_, I thought _captain_ and 
_contraption_ made the funniest project name. That's all there is to the name.

_captain_contraption_ is my attempt to formalize and share some of the scripts I have used over the years. This is 
really an eclectic mix of scripts with no real overarching plan. I hope these will be useful when you are managing 
the contraptions (computers) over which you are the captain (admin). Of course, please feel free to help me grow 
this project.
